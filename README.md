# The Urban Underdog

The Urban Underdog is an arcade style, 3D racecar driving game where you go for your best time on randomly generated race tracks. The game was programmed in Javascript, and utilizes a custom 3D rendering engine made in Javascript. \

- The goal of this game was to show off the 3D engine. I chose a racing game because the physics and level/track designs could be very simple compared to other game genres
- The gameplay is very simple, you steer by moving the mouse left and right, and you tap space to drift around sharp turns
- Despite its simplicity, the game takes time to master, and smashing your car into walls leads to some very comedic moments
- Track codes can be customized to build your own tracks, and I liked the idea of a community sharing fun tracks and challenges with each other.

The 3D engine is built in Javascript and runs on the CPU. I used vector math to figure out 3D projections, barycentric coordinates, rasterization, and the Jarvis March Algorithm to create the engine and game.

I designed and developed this game/engine in about a month and released the game in December 2020.

Below is a demo video of the game and a video that goes into more depth about the math needed to make a custom 3D rendering engine and randomly generated race tracks.

This video goes into more depth about the 3D engine and the vector math I learned for it.
